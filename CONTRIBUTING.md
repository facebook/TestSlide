# Contributing to TestSlide

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

All TestSlide development is public, and Facebook uses the public repository internally.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

### Setting Up A Development Environment

Generally speaking:

- Install a supported Python version (see `.github/workflows/build.yml`) (suggestion: use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)).
- Install the dependencies: `make install_build_deps`.
- Run the tests: `make` (or `make V=1` for verbose output).

Here's a quick cookbook on how to have a Python installation working using Docker:

- Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/facebook/TestSlide.git`.
- Create the Docker image: `docker create --name testslide --interactive --tty --mount type=bind,source="$PWD"/TestSlide,target=/root/src/TestSlide --workdir=/root/src/TestSlide debian /bin/bash`.
- Start a container with this image: `docker start --interactive testslide`.
- Install the dependencies: `apt update && apt -y install build-essential curl git libbz2-dev libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev llvm vim wget zlib1g-dev`.
- Install pyenv: `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`.
- Add this to `~/.bashrc`:
```
export PATH="/root/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```
- Do `exec bash -i`.
- Install Python: `pyenv install 3.7.3`.
- Enable the installed version `pyenv shell 3.7.3`.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style  

We prefer using [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to format Python code.
